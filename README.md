# Password Generator
Due to the requirements, in this task I developed a new secure password using the program JavaScript and its tools.

After checking the specifications, when the user accesses the webpage he or she is able to create a new password after entering certain parameters, such as: lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers or special characters. The customer needs to choose at least one of the parameters. The user also can select the length of the password. 

Once the user selects the conditions, the website will provide a new password automatically.
